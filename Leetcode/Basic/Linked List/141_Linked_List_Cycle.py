'''
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos 
which represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list 
where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle 
in the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
